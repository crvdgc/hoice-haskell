-- | parse a script to a graph, only accept the following commands:
--
-- * @(set-info _)@   -> ignore
-- * @(set-logic _)@  -> ignore, since we expect HORN with disjunction on the head
-- * @(declare-fun _symbol (_sort*) _sort)@
-- * @(assert (forall/exists (_sortedVar+) (=> _term _term))@
--      where @_sortedVar@ is @(_symbol _sort)@
-- * @(check-sat)@    -> ignore
-- * @(get-model)@    -> ignore
-- * @(exit)@         -> ignore
--
-- all other commands are not expected, but when present, they are ignored as well
--
-- Reference: https://github.com/sosy-lab/sv-benchmarks/blob/master/clauses/README.txt
-- The following directories contain benchmarks in SMT-LIB2.
-- The benchmarks are annotated with (set-logic HORN) to indicate
-- that the formulas belong to a quantified Horn fragment.
-- The asserted formulas are of the form:
--
-- horn ::=
--   |   (forall (quantified-variables) body)
--   |   (not (exists (quantified-variables) co-body))
--
-- body ::=
--   |   (=> co-body body)
--   |   (or literal*)
--   |   literal
--
-- co-body ::=
--   |   (and literal*)
--   |   literal
--
-- literal ::=
--   |   formula over interpreted relations (such as =, <=, >, ...)
--   |   (negated) uninterpreted predicate with arguments
--
-- A body has at most one uninterpreted relation with positive polarity,
-- and a co-body uses only uninterpreted relations with positive polarity.
--
-- Note: however, this hoice solver accepts more than one uninterpreted
-- relations with positive polarity in body.
